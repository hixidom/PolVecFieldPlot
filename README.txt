Polar Vector Field Plotter, by Andrew Barrette

Plots a polar vector field of the form vector={rho(rho,phi),phi(rho,phi)}.

CONTROLS:
=/-	Zoom in/out
p	Toggle arror/streamer plot styles

The following controls require a button to be held down while a value is incremented/decremented using up/down arrow keys:
1	PARAM1 (an adjustable parameter in the vector field equations)
2	PARAM2 (radius of streamer starting positions)
i	arror/streamer interval (i.e. spacing)
l	streamer length
n	arror/streamer quantity
